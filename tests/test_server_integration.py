"""Start the real server as a subprocess and check the flags actually took effect.

This exists because of a bug the unit tests could not see. `settings_from_args` was correct and
`create_app(settings)` was correct, but `main()` handed uvicorn an *import string* — so the
server process rebuilt its settings from the environment and dropped every command-line flag,
while the banner cheerfully claimed they were in effect. Testing the two halves separately can
never catch that; only running the actual command can.

One server process is started per module, with several non-default flags set at once, and each
test asserts that its flag reached the request path.
