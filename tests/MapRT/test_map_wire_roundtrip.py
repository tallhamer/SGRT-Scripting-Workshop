"""**The Phase 3 gate.** What the emulator streams must parse with the real client's parser.

The whole project rests on this: `maprt_workshop.wire.parse_collision_map` is the parser from a
live MapRT integration, and the emulator is written to satisfy *it*, not the other way round. If
the emulator's wire format drifts, a notebook that works here stops meaning anything about the
clinic — so these tests take the emulator's own bytes and push them through the ported parser.

Also pinned here: the shapes. A 1-degree map parses to `(360, 181)`; the specification's coarse
`37,36` sampling parses to `(360, 185)`, because the couch axis spans 180 degrees *inclusive* and
no integer step above 1 both tiles it and fills 181 columns. See `test_collision_map.py` and the
parser's docstring. The two resolutions do not share a shape, and that is arithmetic, not a bug.
