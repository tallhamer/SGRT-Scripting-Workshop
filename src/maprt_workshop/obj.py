"""A minimal ASCII OBJ reader — enough for a MapRT patient surface, in numpy.

The surface_tools application decodes these with VTK, which is the right tool when you already
have a 3D pipeline. For a workshop it is a 200 MB dependency to read two kinds of line, so this
is the whole format MapRT actually emits:

    # VisionRT Ltd.
    # File type: ASCII OBJ
    ps 265857                 <- vertex count (not standard OBJ; ignored here)
    fs 509284                 <- face count (ditto)

    v -258.48 -302.746 27.4538
    ...
    f 2872 3395 3396
    ...

Face indices are **1-based** — the single most common mistake when hand-rolling an OBJ reader,
because an off-by-one silently produces a mesh that looks almost right. ``f a/b/c`` forms
(vertex/texture/normal) are tolerated by taking the first field, and ``vn`` normals are read when
present, so this also handles OBJs from other sources.

Remember what the bytes mean: a MapRT surface is in **NATIVE (couch) coordinates** and carries no
patient-position metadata, so these vertices are not in the DICOM patient frame until you
transform them.
