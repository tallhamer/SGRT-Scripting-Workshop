"""Validate a data directory without starting a server — ``maprt-sim --check-data``.

The loaders refuse to start on anything they cannot read, which is the right behaviour for a
server but a slow way to iterate when you are adding data: edit, start, read a traceback, stop,
repeat. This does the same loading, then goes further and reports the problems that are *not*
fatal but are almost always mistakes — a map recorded against a surface id that no longer exists,
an ``.obj`` nobody references, a plan naming a patient the appliance has never heard of.

Nothing here changes what the server will do. It tells you what it is about to do.
