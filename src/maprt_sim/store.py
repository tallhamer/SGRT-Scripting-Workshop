"""The catalog the simulator serves: treatment rooms, patients, surfaces.

Everything comes out of a folder, so adding data is a file drop and a line of JSON — no code
change. The layout::

    data/MapRT/rooms.json         [{"id", "machineName", "name", "coordinateSystem"}, …]
    data/MapRT/patients.json      {"<patientId>": [{"id", "timeStamp", "timeZone"}, …], …}
    data/MapRT/surfaces/<id>.obj  the mesh served for that surface id
    data/MapRT/local/             an optional overlay, git-ignored — see below

``data/MapRT/local/`` shadows ``data/MapRT/``: a ``rooms.json`` or ``patients.json`` there replaces the
public one, and surfaces there are added to (and win over) the public ones. That is where real
exported patient surfaces go on a machine that has them, so patient-derived data can never
become a commit candidate.
