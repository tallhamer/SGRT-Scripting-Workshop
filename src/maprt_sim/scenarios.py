"""Fault injection: making every error branch reproducible on demand.

A client's error handling is the part that never gets tested, because the failures it exists for
are the ones you cannot arrange. An unlicensed feature needs an appliance without the licence; a
throttled server needs a busy one; a timeout needs patience. So they get written once, guessed
at, and never exercised — and then they are what fails on a Friday afternoon.

Arming a scenario makes the failure happen on the next request::

    POST /sim/scenario  {"name": "unlicensed-map"}
    POST /sim/scenario  {"name": "ok"}            # back to normal

**The /sim routes are deliberately unauthenticated.** The ``bad-token`` scenario makes the
appliance reject every token, so if disarming it needed a working token there would be no way
back out without restarting the server. A control surface you can lock yourself out of is a
control surface nobody will risk using.
