"""Computing a plausible clearance map, and writing it in the GetMap wire format.

**This is not a collision engine and its answers are not physics.** It is a small geometric model
chosen so the map *responds to the request the way a real one does*, which is what makes it
teachable: widen a buffer and the collision region grows, kick the couch and the safe gantry band
narrows into the bow-tie shape a planner recognises, move the isocenter towards the shoulder and
the map gets worse on one side. A student can reason about what they see and be right about the
reasoning, even though the numbers are invented.

What it is built on:

* The **real surface mesh** of the requested patient, decimated to a point cloud. So two patients
  genuinely get different maps, for the right reason — their bodies are different shapes — rather
  than from a hash of their id.
* The gantry head modelled as a sphere of :data:`HEAD_RADIUS` at :data:`HEAD_DISTANCE` from the
  isocenter, which is roughly where a linac's collimator housing sits.
* The couch modelled as a thin **slab** below the patient — a board, not a half-space. This
  matters more than it sounds: modelled as a half-space, the couch blocks every gantry angle
  below horizontal, so the whole of gantry 150-210 comes back as a collision at every couch
  angle. On a real linac the head swings freely *under* the board and a posterior beam is
  routinely clear, so a half-space produces maps that are obviously wrong to anyone who has
  seen a real one.

Not modelled: the couch pedestal and support arm. Those are a real source of collisions at large
couch kicks, so the simulator is more optimistic than reality at the inferior end.

The geometry worth understanding is where the source ends up in the *patient's* frame. The gantry
rotates in a fixed room plane and the couch rotates the patient, so with gantry ``g`` and couch
``c``, the source sits at (relative to the isocenter, in patient coordinates)::

    along the patient's long axis   R * sin(g) * sin(c)
    lateral                         R * sin(g) * cos(c)
    vertical                        R * cos(g)

Read that and the shape of every clearance map follows. At gantry 0 or 180 the ``sin(g)`` terms
vanish: the source is straight above or below the isocenter and **the couch angle cannot matter**.
At gantry 90 with the couch kicked to 90, the source swings a full ``R`` along the patient's axis,
out over the head or the feet — which is exactly where real collisions happen, and why the safe
region pinches as the couch rotates.
