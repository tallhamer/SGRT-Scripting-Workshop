"""Recorded clearance maps: serving a real GetMap response body back out of a folder.

The synthetic generator in :mod:`maprt_emulator.mapgen` is plausible but invented. When you have a
*real* appliance response, you can drop it in here and the simulator will serve the real bytes —
which is what you want for a live demo, and the only way the workshop shows anyone a map that
actually came off a linac.

    data/MapRT/maps/index.json   [{"file", "surfaceId", "roomId", "patientPosition",
                                   "couchBuffer", "patientBuffer", "isocenter": [x, y, z],
                                   "highResolution": bool, "note": "..."}, …]
    data/MapRT/maps/<name>.txt   the raw GetMap response body, verbatim, including the DONE line

``data/MapRT/local/maps/`` overlays this, git-ignored, which is where patient-derived recordings belong.

Resolution order for a request, reported back in the ``X-Sim-Map-Source`` response header:

``recorded``
    Every keyed field matches a recording. You are looking at real bytes.
``recorded-nearest``
    Same surface, room and resolution, but a different isocenter — the closest recording is
    served. Keeps a notebook working when a student types an arbitrary isocenter, at the cost of
    the answer not being for the setup they asked about. Hence the header.
``synthetic``
    No recording applies, so the model computed one.

That header exists because "is this real?" is a question a student should always be able to
answer, and because a nearest-match is a quietly wrong answer if nothing says so.
