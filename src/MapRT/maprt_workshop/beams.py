"""Beam-vs-collision-map checking — verdicts and plot geometry, numpy only.

`check_beams` takes a plan's beams and a MapRT collision map and decides, for each beam, whether
every gantry position it occupies is clear. Ported from ``maprt_client.beams`` in the
surface_tools project.

Why a client-side check at all, when the appliance has GetBeamDeliveryStatus? Two reasons, both
worth a workshop discussion: it is free once you already hold the map (no second round trip per
what-if), and it is the only way to answer "what *would* be deliverable" for angles the plan does
not contain. The notebooks check the two against each other.

The hard part is not the lookup, it is the wrap-around. The map's rows run gantry 180…359 then
0…179, so an arc crossing gantry 180 wraps around the end of the array — and a naive
``array[start:stop]`` slice whose stop precedes its start is *empty*, which ``np.all`` reports as
safe. That failure mode passes a colliding arc. Hence the modular index stepping below.

    The angle arrives as a DS string on the IEC 61217 0-360 scale — the nominal value,
    with any extended-range designation already dropped by the planning system, so `180E`
    reaches here as `180`. Gantry runs 0..359.9 and couch 270..359.9 and 0..90.0; in both
    cases 360 denotes the same position as 0.

    Only one input needs adjusting, and it is one this function creates: rounding
    359.5..359.9 produces 360, which is not a key. That wraps to 0.

    Anything else is rounded to the nearest position and left to stand or fail on its
    own. A value off the scale therefore fails the lookup rather than being reduced onto
    a row that would pass for real — a gantry angle of 545 must not quietly become 185 in
